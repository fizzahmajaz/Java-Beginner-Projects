# 🧮 Odd Number Addition

## 📌 Description

This is a simple Java console application that continuously takes input from the user and calculates the **sum of all odd numbers**. The user can keep entering numbers until they type `0`, which ends the input process and displays the final sum.

It’s a beginner-friendly project that helps in understanding **functions, loops, conditionals, and user input** in Java.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user is asked to input a number.
2. If the first number is `0`, the program exits with an invalid input message.
3. If the number is odd (`n % 2 != 0`), it is added to the total sum.
4. The program enters a loop to keep taking numbers:
   - Each new number is checked.
   - If it's odd, it's added to the sum.
   - If it's `0`, the loop stops.
5. The final sum is printed.
